==Abstract==
Contest: Redesign the PART/DCR atomic swap infographic or make a new one from scratch.

==Scope==
The recently posted PART/DCR atomic swap is good for giving the information about the atomic swap process, but is not very pretty. The goal of this contest is to create a new atomic swap infographic from scratch. It can be inspired by the aformentioned PART/DCR infographic, or can be designed in a totally different fashion.

==Requirements==
* The infographic must detail all the steps of the atomic swap process, from the moment both participants create their deposit address to the moment they receive their atomically swapped coin. 
* Must be submitted before the contest deadline
* Must be properly written in english with no type
* Must be represented as a timeline or clearly show the evolution of time throughout the atomic swap process between the two participants

==Milestones==
* Create an account on threadless.com
* Submit to Cryptoguard before the end of the contest

==Timeframe==
A day or two

==POP Completion Reward==
'''Winner: 15 PART'''
